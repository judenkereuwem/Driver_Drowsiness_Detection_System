# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection_System

Drowsy driving is a major cause of road accidents, but early signs of fatigue can be detected before a critical situation arises. This device is a Driver Drowsiness Detection System which uses face landmark detection and image processing to track eye movements and alert drivers if they start dozing off.

Hardware Tech Stack
- Raspberry Pi 5 
ðŸ”¹ Pi Camera
ðŸ”¹ Pan/tilt camera mount with 2 servo motors
ðŸ”¹ Arduino Nano - controlling servos
ðŸ”¹ Buzzer

Software Tech Stack
ðŸ”¹ Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm)
ðŸ”¹ Python3.11
ðŸ”¹ Mediapipe (Face landmark detection)
ðŸ”¹ Arduino IDE

How It Works
ðŸ“Œ The device is placed on the car dashboard, facing the driver.
ðŸ“Œ The system only tracks the face that is within 60 cm of the camera. (To ensure the camera focuses only on the driver).
ðŸ“Œ The pan/tilt camera mount adjusts the camera automatically to keep the driverâ€™s face always in focus.
ðŸ“Œ The system monitors the distance between the upper and lower eyelids:
	- Large distance = Eyes open (awake).
	- Small distance = Eyes closed (potentially sleeping).
ðŸ“Œ If eyes remain closed for 2+ seconds, a buzzer sounds until the driver is alert.

Future Upgrades
ðŸ”¹ Night Vision for low-light detection.
ðŸ”¹ Call or Notification System to alert a third party if the driver remains unresponsive to the buzzer.
ðŸ”¹ Vibration Motor on the steering wheel or seat to physically alert the driver.

This project aims to reduce road accidents and save lives with AI-powered monitoring. Looking forward to enhancing it further! ðŸš€
